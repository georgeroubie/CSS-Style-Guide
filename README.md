# CSS Style Guides

> This is the CSS Style Guide that I use, for my own apps.

## Naming

* Name your CSS Classes and IDs based on what they are, not what they look like
* Use hyphens for CSS Classes `.btn-warning`
* Use underscores for CSS IDs `#top_menu`

## Comments

* Use `//` insted of `/* */`, if you are using a CSS Preprocessor
* Use comment section to explain what the class does

```css
//BAD Example
// inline form element
.inline-form-element{
}

//GOOD Example
// inputs, buttons and text areas will be displayed in the same line
.inline-form-element{
}
```
